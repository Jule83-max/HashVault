Advanced_Port_Scanner_2.5.3869.exe is an executable file associated with the Advanced Port Scanner software developed by Famatech, designed to help users scan their networks for open ports and services. This version, 2.5.3869.0, is generally considered safe when downloaded from the official Famatech website or reputable sources; however, it has been reported in some instances to trigger false positives from antivirus programs due to its network scanning capabilities, which can be misconstrued as suspicious behavior. Users may encounter errors during installation or execution, such as compatibility issues with certain operating systems or insufficient permissions, which can hinder the software's performance. To ensure safety, it is advisable to verify the file's integrity and source before running it, as malicious versions could exist that disguise themselves as the legitimate software.
