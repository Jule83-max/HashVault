As a legitimate component of the antivirus suite, AlertHost.exe is designed to handle alert notifications and manage security-related events on the user's system. Generally, it is considered safe and does not pose a threat as it is part of a reputable security solution; however, users may occasionally encounter errors or issues related to the executable, which could arise from conflicts with other software, system corruption, or incomplete installations.
