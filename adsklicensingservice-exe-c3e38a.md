AdskLicensingService.exe is a legitimate executable file associated with Autodesk's software, particularly AutoCAD, and serves as a licensing service that manages the activation and validation of Autodesk products. Published by Autodesk, Inc., and currently at version 10.7.1.1452, this file is generally safe to have on your system and is essential for ensuring that your Autodesk software operates correctly without licensing issues. However, like many executable files, it can sometimes be mimicked by malware, so it's important to verify its source and location, typically found in the Autodesk installation directory. Users may occasionally encounter errors related to this service, such as licensing issues or problems during software startup, which can often be resolved through troubleshooting steps like repair installations or updates. Overall, as long as it is the genuine file from Autodesk, AdskLicensingService.exe should not be flagged as a virus or malware, but users should remain vigilant and keep their antivirus software updated to prevent any potential threats.
