Alcohol.exe is the executable file associated with Alcohol 120%, a software application developed by Alcohol Soft that enables users to create, manage, and emulate virtual drives and optical discs. As a legitimate utility for backing up and managing disc images, Alcohol 120% is widely used for its ability to handle various formats, including ISO and BIN files. The specific version, 2.0.3.9326, is part of the software's earlier iterations and is generally considered safe to use, provided it is downloaded from the official Alcohol Soft website or a reputable source. However, users may encounter issues such as installation errors or crashes, particularly on newer operating systems or when conflicting software is present. It is important to ensure that the file is not a disguised version of malware, as malware authors sometimes use familiar filenames to trick users; therefore, itâ€™s advisable to scan the file with antivirus software to confirm its authenticity and safety before executing it on your system.
